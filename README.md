# Unsupervised Image Clustering on Digital Handwritten Digits

## Introduction

This project is an unsupervised learning of image classification utilizing the MNIST dataset. The goal is to cluster the images into 10 groups, each representing a digit from 0 to 9. The model is built using PyTorch and trained locally.

## Pre-requisites

For the requirment you can install the packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or you can install the packages manually

## Data Set

The MNIST dataset is utilized for this project, and it can be foudn in the `data` directory.

## Usage

The test code is available in `model_test.ipynb`. Ensure that you a have Jupyter Notebook environment set up.
